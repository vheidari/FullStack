# FullStack

Here, we do `FullStack`. Probably `FullStack`!!

It means we will learn a lot of tools and tasks, and write a lot of code samples to understand how things work. How can we bring up an app or service? And so on...

There aren't any limitations on any `Programming Language` or tools. We will select a `Programming Language` or tools depending on the use case. 

For example, it might involve working on some examples with `GraphQL JS` in pure `JavaScript`, or we will do another on `Apollo GraphQL` with `TypeScript`.


## Repository Structure :
The `Structure` is simple. Each project that I start will get a number and a directory. For example, the first project I tried to work on was `GraphQL`, and it gets labeled as `01.GraphQL`. You can find all code examples inside it.

Each main directory, like `01.GraphQL`, `02.Docker`, etc., contains a `README.md` file that I encourage you to read before jumping into each code example. ;)

Each code example will have its own directory and files. I try to keep them simple.


## How can I Follow Examples

You can select or follow any project in your own way. If you decide to learn or read some code examples about `GraphQL`, you can go to the `01.GraphQL` directory, read its `README` file, and then select a project and start reading and running the code.

I should mention that sometimes each project might have its `README.md` file, which provides you with much more information about the project.

Inside each `README.md` file, I try to add useful information about a `Tool` or `Topic` that could help you understand the code much better. For that reason, I encourage you to read the `README.md` files before doing anything.
