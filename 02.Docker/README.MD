# Inside Docker directory

Here, we would like to do some cool stuff with Docker. We are trying to learn how it works and how we can get our service up and running through Docker. Additionally, we should learn about `Docker Engine`, `Docker Compose`, and `Docker Desktop` through simple examples.

## Installing Docker

To install the latest version of Docker on your machine, I suggest going to the ../Tools/Docker directory in the `Fullstack` repository and using `InstallDockerOnTheUbuntu.sh` to install `Docker` on your `Ubuntu-based` machine. If you are using a different operating system, you can go to the link below and follow its instructions to install Docker on your machine:

```
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
```
Inside the `../Tools/Docker` directory, there are a couple of useful scripts that will help you get up and running and testing Docker. I suggest reading `README.md` in the `../Tools/Docker` directory to understand how each script works. :)
